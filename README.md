  - `submit-onboarding-step`: Handles step submissions
  - `set-onboarding-visibility`: Manages onboarding card visibility

### User Flow
1. Users see onboarding card on challenges page (if not hidden)
2. Click to start onboarding wizard
3. Progress through steps with video content and instructions
4. Submit work for each step (validated on client and server)
5. Automatic progression tracking and step unlocking
6. Return to exact step if leaving and coming back
7. **Final completion creates master submission for admin review**
8. **Admin reviews and approves/rejects complete onboarding**

### Admin Review System
