Replace the old free-form submission system with automated code verification for NoCodeJam onboarding.

## âœ… COMPLETED TASKS

### Backend Infrastructure
- [x] Database Migration: Added `latest_completed_step` column to users table
- [x] Supabase Edge Function: Created `update-onboarding-progress` function
- [x] Supabase Edge Function: Refactored `get-onboarding-progress` to return simplified data
- [x] API Service Layer: Created `onboardingService.ts` with typed functions
- [x] Testing Page: Created comprehensive testing interface for API verification

### Frontend Refactoring
- [x] Progress Bar Component: Refactored to use `latestCompletedStep` instead of array-based tracking
- [x] Onboarding Page: Refactored main onboarding page to use new progress system
- [x] Completion Logic: Fixed logic to properly show OnboardingCompleteScreen
- [x] Submission Form Removal: Removed old OnboardingSubmissionForm and associated logic
- [x] Download Functionality: Added conditional download button for challenge files

### Testing & Validation
- [x] Component Tests: Updated all test files to use new prop interfaces
- [x] API Testing: Verified backend functions work correctly
- [x] Integration Testing: Confirmed progress tracking works end-to-end

## ðŸš§ CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS

### Verification System Implementation
- [ ] Verification Form: Create code input field for text submission steps
- [ ] Verify Button: Implement dual-purpose button (Verify/Next) with loading states
- [ ] API Integration: Connect to verification Edge Function
- [ ] Error Handling: Add proper error states and user feedback
- [ ] Success States: Handle successful verification and progress updates

## ðŸ“‹ REMAINING TASKS

### Verification System
- [ ] Create `verify` Edge Function for code verification
- [ ] Implement verification logic (compare user input vs expected code)
- [ ] Add verification state management (loading, success, error)
- [ ] Update UI to show verification results
- [ ] Handle edge cases (invalid codes, network errors, etc.)

### File Storage Setup
- [ ] Configure Supabase Storage bucket for challenge files
- [ ] Upload challenge files to storage
- [ ] Update database schema to include download URLs
- [ ] Test file download functionality

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add loading states for verification process
- [ ] Implement success/error feedback animations
- [ ] Add progress indicators for file downloads
- [ ] Polish verification form styling

### Testing & QA
- [ ] End-to-end testing of complete verification flow
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Error scenario testing

## ðŸ”„ RECENT CHANGES (Last Updated: September 3, 2025)
- Added download button functionality with conditional display
- Updated OnboardingStep interface to include download_url field
